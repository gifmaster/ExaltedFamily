Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Exalted collects, why, and how it is used.

1. What Data We Collect
When you use Exalted, we may collect:

Your Discord user ID, server ID, and channel ID (to operate the bot’s economy & features).

Economy-related data (your balance, transactions, or points within the bot).

Data from third-party APIs (e.g., Brawl Stars username/stats) if you choose to connect your account in the future.

We do not collect your email, password, or any sensitive personal information.

2. How We Use Data
To provide and improve the bot’s functionality.

To display leaderboards, economy balances, and connected game stats.

To detect and prevent abuse of the bot.

3. How We Store Data
Data is stored securely and only for as long as necessary to provide the bot’s features.

We strive to protect your data, but cannot guarantee absolute security.

4. Sharing Data
We do not sell or share your data with third parties.

Data may be shared if required by law or to enforce our Terms of Service.

5. Your Choices
You can request deletion of your data by contacting us at [Discord: iliketurtlesog].

Removing the bot from your server stops future data collection, but existing data may remain until deleted upon request.

Removing your data will also remove your access to the bot and its functionalities.

If you have any questions about your privacy, contact us at: [Discord: iliketurtlesog].
